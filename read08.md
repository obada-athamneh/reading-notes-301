# Introduction to SQL

* Welcome to SQLBolt, a series of interactive lessons and exercises designed to help you quickly learn SQL right in your browser.


## What is SQL?

**SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications**

### Relational databases

* Before learning the SQL syntax, it's important to have a model for what a relational database actually is. A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.


## About the lessons

* Since most users will be learning SQL to interact with an existing database, the lessons begin by introducing you to the various parts of an SQL query. The later lessons will then show you how to alter a table (or schema) and create new tables from scratch.


## SQL Lesson 1: SELECT queries 101

* To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements, which are often colloquially refered to as queries. A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned. It has a specific syntax though, which is what we are going to learn in the following exercises.
