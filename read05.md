# Node.js For Beginners. Deploy Your Blog to Heroku

* Error pages are not what typically appear on your screen when you're surfing the web, but when it happens it's so annoying! To see how servers work from within, we will build a simple web server by ourselves. We will use Node.js as a server part technology for that task. Then we'll use Heroku cloud application platform to turn this local server into a world wide server.


## Why should I?

**Hi, everyone! Don't know how about you, but my weekend was great!**
**Friday evening. I came home from work, fed my cat, grabbed some pizza, and wanted to have some fun. What could be funnier than good old movies? Nothing, right? So, I went to "IMDB Top 500" to choose one. Then this happened**

### How can I?

* We will use Node.js for our project. Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment, which allows you to build server-side and networking applications. It's written in JavaScript and can be run within the Node.js runtime on any platform. First of all, of course, you need to install it. You'd better check the download page for more details. I'll wait until you finish, so don't worry. Is it done? Great! Now you can create your first web server. And it will be one of the easiest tasks in your life.


## Make it worldwide

* Works fine. But it works locally. WWW is for "World Wide Web" and we will turn your local server into a world wide server. We'll use Heroku cloud application platform for this. Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (cool long-bearded programmer guys call such type of things "PaaS"). It allows you to deploy your web server, so everyone could see how awesome you are as a web developer. First of all, you need to create an account on developer's site and install Heroku. This is not so hard. Just follow the instructions. There is also instruction on Heroku's site that can explain you how to run your first simple web server, which returns you the "Hello, World!" string. You can try it, but I think that it will be more interesting if we build our own web server from scratch. Sounds exciting, huh?


## Looking back

**We've built our own web server using less than 50 lines of code. Not so hard, if you ask me. It's pretty simple, yes. But you can see, how average server works. It was a simple task. But you can combine Node.js with different technologies, such as CSS3 and HTML5, then spice it with some JavaScript functionality. There is really a lot of libraries and frameworks to take a look at. Personally I started to dig into Webix, it's a relatively new library and is developed by a small software company from Eastern Europe. Samples of apps made with the library and Node.js: CRM and task planner. Seems like you can create anything with the right client-side framework and Node.js.**
