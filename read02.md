# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

### How does pair programming work?
* While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.


## Why pair program?

**While learning to code, developers likely study several programming languages. Similar to a foreign language class, there are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language: Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful**

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness


# jQuery
* jQuery offers a simple way to achieve a variety of common 
JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently, across all major 
browsers and without any fallback code needed. 

## WHY USE JQUERY? 

* jQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript. 
* It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler

# EFFECTS 

* When you start using jQuery, the effects methods can enhance your web
