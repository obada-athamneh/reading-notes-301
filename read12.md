# EJS Partials

* Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views. Think of partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you don’t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in. Instead, you define that reusable bundle of code in a file andinclude it wherever you need it.

**Our blog will consist of a home page which lists all the blog posts and a post page which will display a single post. Our home page will look like so**

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ANGULAR 2 COURSE

1. Do I need to know Angular 1 before taking this course?

* No! Angular 2 is an entirely new framework and this course assumes no prior knowledge of Angular.


2. Angular 2 is in beta. Will this course be updated?

* Certainly, This course will be updated continuously until final version of Angular 2. You’ll find updates from beta to final release in the last section of the course.


3. Why is the course with TypeScript? Why not Javascript?

* TypeScript is a superset of Javascript, meaning any valid Javascript code is valid TypeScript. If you can write Javascript code, you can write TypeScript code! So you don’t have to learn a new programming language. TypeScript brings many useful features to Javascript that are missing in the current version of Javascript. We get classes, modules, interfaces, properties, constructors, access modifiers (e.g. public/private), IntelliSense and compile-time checking. So, we can catch many programming errors at compile-time.



4. Why should I pay for this course when there are lots of free tutorials available?

#### Free tutorials and YouTube videos are free for a reason. They introduce you to a few concepts here and there, but soon you’ll find yourself jumping from one tutorial to another to fill the missing gaps. By taking a perfectly-structured course, you’ll be confident that you’re in good hands, right from the beginning all the way through to the very end. You pay for saving your precious time: the time that you can spend on the things you love.
