# Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript

## After a long time learning and working with object-oriented programming, I took a step back to think about system complexity.

* Doing some research, I found functional programming concepts like immutability and pure function. Those concepts are big advantages to build side-effect-free functions, so it is easier to maintain systems — with some other benefits.

### What is functional programming?

* Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia

## Pure functions

**The first fundamental concept we learn when we want to understand functional programming is pure functions. But what does that really mean? What makes a function pure?**

# Refactoring JavaScript for Performance and Readability

* Recently, I wrote an article about how to write very fast JavaScript. Some of the examples took it to the extreme and became very quick at the cost of being totally unmaintainable. There's a middle ground between speed and comprehension and that's where good code lives.


1. Scenario 1
* We're an URL-shortening website, like TinyURL. We accept a long URL and return a short URL that forwards visitors to the long URL. We have two functions.

2. Scenario 2

* We're a social media website where user URLs are generated randomly. Instead of random gibberish, we're going to use the friendly-words package that the Glitch team works on. They use this to generate the random names for your recently created projects!
